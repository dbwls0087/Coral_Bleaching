# Coral_Bleaching

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict coral bleaching events using marine environmental data such as sea temperature, salinity, and other oceanographic variables.  
This repository contains a backup of the work I contributed to during a team project, organized for portfolio purposes.

## Dataset

## My Contribution
- Participated in model design based on data characteristic analysis
- Improved model performance through threshold tuning

## Goal
To develop a machine learning model capable of predicting coral bleaching occurrence and to gain practical experience in environmental data analysis and predictive modeling.
